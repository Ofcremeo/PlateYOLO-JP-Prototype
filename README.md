## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Quickly identify and classify Japanese license plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Leverage advanced algorithms for reliable recognition.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with various applications and platforms.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development allows for continuous improvement.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several key technologies:

- **ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)**: For recognizing and processing license plates.
- **Object Detection**: The core algorithm for identifying plates in images.
- **ONNX**: Model format for interoperability across different frameworks.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For model training and inference.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ofcremeo/PlateYOLO-JP-Prototype.git
   cd PlateYOLO-JP-Prototype
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Models**:

   Visit our [Releases page](https://github.com/Ofcremeo/PlateYOLO-JP-Prototype/releases) to download the necessary models. Extract them to the `models/` directory in your project.

## Usage

To run the prototype, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_your_image_or_video>
```

Replace `<path_to_your_image_or_video>` with the path to the image or video file you want to process.

### Example

To test the prototype with an image, use:

```bash
python main.py --input images/test_image.jpg
```

## Model Training

If you want to train your own model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:

   Collect a dataset of Japanese license plates. Ensure that images are labeled correctly.

2. **Configure Training Parameters**:

   Modify the `config.py` file to set your training parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

3. **Start Training**:

   Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset <path_to_your_dataset>
   ```

4. **Monitor Training**:

   Use TensorBoard to monitor your training progress. Run:

   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir logs/
   ```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of your trained model, use the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_your_model> --dataset <path_to_your_test_dataset>
```

This will provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
